installation is different on each OS 
so will go for docker where we will write a docker compose file with feww instructios which are independent of OS

to install kafka on docker containwer we need,
 1. instance of zookeeper and
 2. an instance of kafka
so we will create docker-compose.yml file and in that file we will define two services one for zookeper and kafka serve
and will ask docker to create these 2 instances for us

create dicker-compose.yml file with content below
version:'3.1'

services:
  zookeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeper
    container_name:zookeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
  kafka:
    image:wurstmeister/kafka
    container_name:kafka
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: localhost
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181

start he docker desktop and in the directory where file is present execute docker compose up -d

docker ps -> to know the running images

docker exec -it "containerid"(kafka) /bin/sh -> to go inside kafka image
inside this kafka container execute the commands to create a topic,
