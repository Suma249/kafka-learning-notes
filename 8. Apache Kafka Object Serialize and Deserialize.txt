kafka consumer and producer code that we wrote befor ewill only accept string if we try to try iwth other data typ eit wont acept

create a dto pacakge and a class customer, we have a customerdto class created in producer application
add the method sendEventstotopic that accepts customerdto object in service layer of producer application and in the controller layer define the one more controller
for cusyomerdto, it is a post request
topic is learning-kafka-topic2,with group id consumer-group2, for string it was learning-kafka-topic1

in consumer class, in consume1 method modify the type of data which is customerdto 

now if we make a call to end point to, it will thrown an exception because topic will accept input as byte arrat
from producer perspective we have to serialize and from consumer perspective input should be deserialized

kafka can serialize and deserialize string but not other objects, and we have to specify that extrnally
for this in producer application.properties add key and value serializer
and do the same in consumer application.properties

instead of defining everything in application.properties we can also customize it 
in producer application, in config class define the method prodcerconfig annotated wth bean, and using this prodcerconfg bean we can create a producerfactory
now create a kafka template object by giving this producerFactory bean
