in kafka, once producer send bulk message it will split into partitions and similary consumer will consume from all partitions
how we can control producer to sed messages to single paetition and similarly for consumer

to send data to a single partition of a tipic, we can tell to kafkatemplate the partition 
template.send("string-data-topic",2,null,message);

to make condsumer read from a particular partition
