we can create multiple consumer instances and we can group them with unique id and this id will indicate the task of the consumer group

create spring starter project with web and kafka dependencies

create a class kafmessagelistener in service package and a methid consume and annotate this methoid with kafkalisatener mentioning the topics thsat this 
consumer has to read from


we need to map a consumer to a group id else kafka will throw an error
and add the group id in thre application.properties as well in the annotation @Kafkalistener annotation

each consumer will read from each partition of that topic if there are more consumers compared to number of partitions, the extra consumer will be aitting idle

consumer rebalancing?

create 3 extra consumers under the same grioup id, listening to same topic
